		Note: Run DB compare.

2017-07-18 4.2.8 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fixed RTE configuration for generic product text fields made editable via EXTCONF.

2017-03-28 4.2.7 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Changed ProductController::detailAction from cachable to nonCachable.
	* Adjusted feature for use as nonCachable action: controllers.Product.title.useRecordAsPageTitle.

2017-03-14 4.2.6 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Added Service\Backend\Form\FormDataProvider\DatabaseRowModifier to replace former getMainFieldsClass hook.
		@see https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/7.6/Changelog/7.5/Breaking-69568-FormEngine.html

		The new DatabaseRowModified is registered to be ordered before
			\TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Form\FormDataProvider\DatabaseRowDefaultValues
		@see https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/7.6/Changelog/7.5/Feature-69568-FormEngineDataProcessing.html

	* Added missing definition of Domain\Model\ReferenceLink::SUBTYPE_CTA_BUTTON.
	* Migrated relation record AddController (overriding the core's AddController to pass on type and subType parameters)
		to TYPO3 7.6 LTS.

	* Fixed ReferenceLink subtype select TCA field definition: Default value changed from '' to '0', as defined as
	 	default value in ext_tables.sql.


2017-03-10 4.2.5 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Increased DB FAQ owms_core_language field from VARCHAR(2) to VARCHAR(32), to allow OWMS valid language codes:
		See: EXT:ncgov_pdc/ext_tables-migration-v3.2.1.sql
		See: http://standaarden.overheid.nl/owms/3.5/doc/eigenschappen/dcterms.language
		See: http://standaarden.overheid.nl/owms/3.5/doc/syntax-codeerschemas/dcterms.rfc4646

	Please run this migration script! EXT:ncgov_pdc/ext_tables-migration-v4.2.5.sql

2017-03-10 4.2.4 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Increased Log message frame size and wizard popup window sizes.

2017-03-10 4.2.3 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Switched from TCA script wizards to new module wizards.
	* Changed TCA iconfile definition to using EXT:nc_extbase_lib/ prefix rather than absolute path.
	* Moved from string-defined class names to ::class for all but TCA.
	* Simplified most cases of Fully Qualified Class Names (not in Exception classes - that gets too confusing :)).

2017-03-10 4.2.2 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Removed pdc:form (\Netcreators\NcgovPdc\ViewHelpers\FormViewHelper/)
	* Removed usage of pdc:form by f:form (\TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\ViewHelpers\FormViewHelper)
		Note: Check changelog "2010-11-02 1.2.0 Frans van der Veen". pdc:form was added for W3 validity & comliance.
				This should not anymore be necessary to date.
	* Fixed Samenwerkende Catalogi feed output: Broken XML prologue.
	* Fixed Samenwerkende Catalogi feed rendering: invalid leading backslash for FQN of UniformProductNameListReader.

2017-03-03 4.2.1 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Reformatted for PSR-2.
	* Configured default view.templateRootPaths.0.
	* Configured default view.partialRootPaths.0.
	* Configured default view.layoutRootPaths.0.

	Use templateRootPaths.1 for fileadmin/site/...

2016-09-16 4.2.0 Tania Morales <extensions@netcreators.nl>
	* Initial update for 7.6 compatibility

2016-09-16 4.1.14 Tania Morales <extensions@netcreators.nl>
	* Added custom_label field to products. Requested by maastricht to show custom button labels on detail page.
		Run DB compare.

2016-06-23 4.1.13 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix: Declared dependency of tt_address to ensure correct ext_tables loading order and TCA
		DataMap/ColumnMap creation.

		(ncgov_pdc used to be included before tt_address, which caused that ncgov_pdc/ext_tables.php could not
		add columns to the tt_address table. It is not yet possible to use
		ncgov_pdc/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_address.php because tt_address first needs to migrate
		to the 'new style' TCA declaration.)

2016-01-27 4.1.12 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* TCA Product.weight is no longer required. Defaults to 0 in the database.
	* Product search results now show product.shortDescription if product.owmsMantleAbstract is not available.
		(For products manually created in the TYPO3 BE.)
	* A-Z Index now links letters to section '#pdc-az-index-container' for cases where the A-Z Index plugin is not placed at the top of the page.

2016-01-26 4.1.11 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix: Refactored Product::azIndex(), so now the 'noProducts' class works again.
	* Added various FlexForm options where previously TS (and conditions) would have needed to be used.
		- Audience for Product::azIndex()
		- Display (yes/no) for FAQ::find() search form parameter checkboxes:
		 	- match exact phrase,
		 	- include private results,
		 	- include business results,
		 	- include remote products
	* Set default TS value: settings.controllers.FrequentlyAskedQuestion.actions.find.showSearchBox = 1 (old value: unset; defaults to FALSE)
	* Unified Fluid template namespace aliases from 'pdc' and 'ncgovPdc' to 'pdc' and from 'ncel' and 'ncExtbaseLib' to 'lib'.


2016-01-26 4.1.10 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* BREAKING (in very rare cases): Fixed spelling of configuration option controllers.FrequentlyAskedQuestion.actions.find.showSingleFrequentlyAskedQuestion
		Used to be showSingleFrequenlyAskedQuestion (Frequenly + t = Frequently)

		PLEASE UPDATE YOUR TYPOSCRIPT AND FLEXFORM CONFIGURATION!

2015-09-24 4.1.9 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* vac:contactinfo/vac:instantie is now hidden by default. In SDU VACs, this is supposed to be a private field.
		Other Antwoord providers might handle this differently - in this case please uncomment the
		"frequentlyAskedQuestion.contactAddresses" section in Resources/Private/Templates/FrequentlyAskedQuestion/Detail.html.

2015-07-23 4.1.8 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Removed all code related to \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\ViewHelpers\ContactInstance\IsPublicContactInstanceViewHelper.

2015-07-08 4.1.7 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix for
		"Fatal error: Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency? in ncgov_pdc/Classes/Services/Registration/Manager.php on line 294"
		@see http://www.richardlord.net/blog/php-nesting-level-too-deep-recursive-dependency

2015-04-28 4.1.6 Arek van Schaijk <arek@netcreators.nl>
	* FrequentlyAskedQuestionController->detail() finished the '404' handler which was commented as TODO

2015-04-16 4.1.5 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Increasing tt_address.phone field length: Now working again, with corresponding code re-added to ext_tables.php.
		The code in Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_address.php will not work as long as EXT:tt_address is including their
		TCA in ext_tables.php instead of via Configuration/TCA/.

2015-04-16 4.1.4 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Using new (nc_extbase_lib v.1.8) parameter $identifierField of \Netcreators\NcExtbaseLib\Service\Object\Synchronization\AbstractObjectSynchronizer::getOrLoadCachedById().
		Among other instances, the method is used to find existing FAQ and Product records in the various PDC synchronizers.

		SDU provides a separate, *numeric* ScmetaProductId, and an *URI* OwmsCoreIdentifier. SDU relates FAQs to Products via the *numeric* ScmetaProductId.
		Opus+ on the other hand uses the OwmsCoreIdentifier for such relations. The Opus+ OwmsCoreIdentifier is a *GUID*.
		Aplus also provides a separate ScmetaProductId and OwmsCoreIdentifier.

		For SDU Product->FAQ relations, getOrLoadCachedById() must be called with $identifierField='ScmetaProductId'.

		ncgov_pdc v4.1.4 depends on nc_extbase_lib v1.1.8 or higher!

2015-04-15 4.1.3 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Added all PDC tabs functionality to Resources/Public/Js/pdc-tabs.js, including pre-selection via #hash or /tab/{tabname} (realURL).
		This way, fileadmin/site/*/script/jquery_functions.js can be free of any PDC tab code.

2015-03-09 4.1.2 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix: Set the correct IntermediateObject::$type
		in \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Service\File\Record\Converter\XmlFaqConverter::createIntermediatesFromNode().

2015-03-09 4.1.1 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Domain\Model\FrequentlyAskedQuestion::$owmsMantleAvailableStart and \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Domain\Model\FrequentlyAskedQuestion::$owmsMantleAvailableEnd
		were party treated as integer (legacy) and partly as \DateTime (new style). This caused validation (and other) issues.
		$raw parameter of \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Domain\Model\FrequentlyAskedQuestion::getOwmsMantleAvailableStart() and
		\Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Domain\Model\FrequentlyAskedQuestion::getOwmsMantleAvailableEnd() was removed.

2015-03-02 4.1.0 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Migration to nc_extbase_lib v1.1.x
	* Namespacing
	* Using new-style (cacheable) TCA and TCA Overrides.
	* Added FAQ Synchronizer delete count
	* Renamed EXTCONF key hideBackendModule: Do not use a positive value to indicate a negated option. Now called 'enableProductMaintenanceModule'.
	* Ported Change from http://hg.netcreators.com:5000/ncgov_pdc/changeset/2b2173daf8ea8f3e463d85ef8615e33fdc0f2df3:
		Adjusted language label for AdvancedTheme Type from PdcX to Pdc, since implementation of the domain model was moved into the core extension.
	* Ported Change from ncgov_pdc v3.2.1 (http://hg.netcreators.com:5000/ncgov_pdc/changeset/262df752ba731ef2caf06c547ff6d80f173dd1ba):
		Product language labels changed from e.g. "nl", "en" to "nl-NL", "en-GB"
	* Ported Change from ncgov_pdc v3.9.0:
		(1) NOTE: The method \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Service\Object\Synchronization\FaqObjectSynchronizer::setLinkData() was introduced in r457:52f24b829d3a,
			existed through several changes and merges until r470:60810445241d, and was removed by a faulty merge (wrong
			merge direction?) in r475:c6086822d693!
			If more things went missing, then check r470:c6086822d693!
		(2) [DB UPDATE] Added feature:
			Now importing FAQ Antwoord Adres and Onderwater Antwoord Adres & displaying in FAQ detail view. (Gemeente Maastricht)
	* Ported Fix from ncgov_pdc v3.9.1: FrequentlyAskedQuestionController::postProcessAnswers() now consistently takes array as 4th argument.
		Previously, it had been QueryResultInterface in some cases, which caused glitches in certain situations.
	* Ported Fix from ncgov_pdc v3.9.2: Due to two separate bugs, Related FAQs were no longer shown on the FAQ detail page since v3.8.7.
	* Removed FrequentlyAskedQuestionController::synchronizeAction().
	* Added FrequentlyAskedQuestionSynchronizerCommandController.
	* Added FrequentlyAskedQuestionSynchronizerModuleController.
	* Fix: Property annotations for Domain\Model\ReferenceLink::$referenceProduct and ...::$referenceLink now use FQN.
	* Fix: Typo XmlFaqConverter::$ex[c]ludedItems.
	* Fixed accessor \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Domain\Model\FrequentlyAskedQuestion::getReferenceFrequentlyAskedQuestions():
		No longer initializing lazy object storage before validation, causing recursive validation of possibly thousands of FAQs.
		Previous method now called \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Domain\Model\FrequentlyAskedQuestion::getReferenceFrequentlyAskedQuestionsFiltered().
		(Unsure about the necessity of this method... @see \Netcreators\NcgovPdc\Controller\FrequentlyAskedQuestionController::assignReferenceFrequentlyAskedQuestions())
	* Fix: In Fluid Templates f:link.controller, replaced controller="Theme" by controller="TioTheme", changed since introduction of Netcreators\NcgovPdcx\Controller\AdvancedThemeController.



2015-01-28 4.0.12 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix: Manually created Products no longer break the XML publish process. (We could make the owms_core_modified field required, but this makes no sense. Instead, the automagic tstamp column is used.)
	* Removed dirty never-to-be-touched-again CSV importer.
	* Merged Classes/Services/ into Classes/Service/.

2015-01-28 4.0.11 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Added constants, property, getter and setter for ReferenceLink::subtype. Subtype should be set during sync, not (only) via EXT:ncgov_pdc/Resources/Private/Scripts/SetSubTypes.php:user_setReferenceLinkSubtypes->setSubtypesFromFieldFromWhichLinkedFromPdc!
	  On a side note, it would have been more elegant to use MM_match_fields and MM_insert_fields.

2015-01-28 4.0.10 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Re-implemented \Tx_NcgovPdc_Domain_Search_Parameter::toXml() for use in \Tx_NcgovPdc_Domain_Model_RegistrationAction::setSearchParameter().
		NOTE:
			Is this cargo cult?? [@Frans?]
			\Tx_NcgovPdc_Domain_Model_RegistrationAction::getSearchParameter() throws a \Tx_NcgovPdc_Exception_NotImplemented!
			Is there any use for this entire mechanism?

2014-11-14 4.0.9 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix in BaseController: Use \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Domain\Model\FrontendUser::getUsergroup() instead of the non-existent getUsergroups().

2014-11-14 4.0.8 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix in various templates: Replace f:form.textbox by f:form.textfield.

2014-10-24 4.0.7 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fixed Publish XML: in TYPO3 6, UriBuilder needs Web Request to be set manually.

2014-10-22 4.0.6 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Replaced remaining t3lib_BEfunc with \TYPO3\CMS\Backend\Utility\BackendUtility.

2014-10-19 4.0.4 Frans van der Veen <extensions@netcreators.nl>
	* Removed old xclass and replaced it through the new object registry (Hook/AddController)

2014-10-15 4.0.3 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* pdc-tabs.js: Increased height calculation of .ncel-tabcontrol-contents, adding a 30 pixel padding, to avoid scrollbars.

2014-09-30 4.0.2 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Template fix: Added extensionName and pluginName to f:link.action in Resources/Private/Templates/Product/ShowRelatedAdvancedThemesForProduct.html

2014-09-30 4.0.1 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* No longer using UriBuilder as property, as the referenced ContentObjectRenderer does not validate when referencing Domain Model is used as Controller Action method parameter.
	* Added new view: Show related advanced themes for given Product.
	* Changed Product::$crdate & $tstamp from \DateTime to integer, due to validation errors.
	* Fix in AdvancedTheme::findByParentOrderByTitle(): Enforcing comparison with 0 instead of NULL on parent reference field. Is this a configuration error or an extbase bug?
	* Fixed several annotations.
	* Fixed several global namespace indications on Exception classes.
	* Added TS "plugin.tx_ncgovpdc.mvc.callDefaultActionIfActionCantBeResolved = 1" to allow for e.g. a 'related themes for product' plugin on the same page as the 'detail' plugin.

2014-09-27 4.0.0 Frans van der Veen <extensions@netcreators.com>
	* More TYPO3 6.2.4 compatibility

	* TYPO3 6.2.4 compatibility

2014-07-31 3.8.7 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* ReferenceLinks now store Products and FrequentlyAskedQuestions as references instead of as UIDs.
	* The FaqSynchronizer calls Repository::update() after updating objects.
	* ReferenceLinks are updated with all available data, also if not newly created.

2014-07-30 3.8.6 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Adjusted nc_extbase_lib minimum version dependency. (nc_extbase_lib v0.2.11 for TYPO3 4.7.)

2014-07-21 3.8.5 Frans van der Veen <extensions@netcreators.com>
	* Added link groups to product
	* Added link groups
	* Removed additional data provider stuff, which is handled by the link groups now

2014-07-14 3.8.4 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Fix: APlus and SDU FAQ feeds are incompatible. The FAQ synchronizer now properly imports APlus answers and authorized answers again.

2014-07-14 3.8.3 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Marked Tx_NcgovPdc_Service_Web_File_Download as deprecated. Please use Tx_NcExtbaseLib_Service_Web_File_Download instead.
	* Marked Tx_NcgovPdc_Services_Web_Rest_Client as deprecated. Pleas use Tx_NcExtbaseLib_Service_Web_Rest_Client instead.
	* Tx_NcgovPdc_Service_MultiPageProcess_FaqSynchronizer uses Tx_NcExtbaseLib_Service_Web_File_RestRequestDownload for FAQ feed download, in order to be able to provide credentials as POST fields. (Needs testing with SDU & Impactive!)
	* Depends on nc_extbase_lib v0.2.8.

2014-06-17 3.8.2 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Added span wrap to Top viewed product/faq: view count. This way, the count can easily be hidden via CSS.

2014-06-17 3.8.1 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Updated extension icon
	* Fixed default value and documentation of AdvancedTheme::setParent(): Now using NULL instead of -1 for root level.
		Note: Default NULL value is a means to allow NULL values when using type hinting.
			  @see http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php "allowing NULL value".

2014-06-17 3.8.0 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>

			settings.viewHelpers.contactInstance.isPublicContactInstance.internalContactInstanceRules
	  Please note that currently only a very limited rule set is implemented.
	  (See Configuration/TypoScript/setup.txt and Classes/ViewHelpers/ContactInstance/IsPublicContactInstanceViewHelper.php.)

2014-05-01 3.6.0 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* Now importing VAC Kanaal contact addresses.

	* Fixed nc_extbase_lib dependency: Minimum v0.2.5 for UrlEncodeViewHelper used in ncgov_pdc 3.2.0+ and higher.

2014-04-28 3.5.1 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>

	* Introduced new template variables for ProductDetail(.sdu/.tabless).html Partial: {showRelatedProducts}, {showRelatedFAQs}, {showRelatedThemes}.
	  This makes it easier to exclude relation links when using Product->detailForPreconfiguredProduct on subsites.
